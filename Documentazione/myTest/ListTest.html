<div class="block">Test class of <code>ListAdapter</code> methods
 <p>
 <p>
 Summary: this class tests the functionality of all ListAdapter methods
 <br><br>
 Design test: in this class every method tests a different method of ListAdapter.
 In every method the execution variables changes before calling the tested method in order to test all the possible conditions
 <br><br>
 Description: The ListAdapter class implements HList and HCollection, therefore the HCollection methods were tested using an HCollection as object
 The ListAdapterTest class deals with the testing for all the methods related
 to the main list and the list iterator, always of the main list.
 For simplicity, the values entered are all integers belonging to the
 Integer class (which however is part of the Object class and therefore
 respects the type of parameters entered) because it can be easily verified
 if the tested methods assume anomalous behavior.
 <br><br>
 Preconditions:
 <br>A new empty object of type ListAdapter must always be instantiated before each test
 <br>All execution variables are never in an uninitialized state (i.e. list = null) unless explicitly desired
 <br>Methods that take as parameters classes that implement HCollection are passed suitable objects for this interface, therefore they do not throw the exception ClassCastException
 <br>All the elements contained in the list are known a priori in order to allow the verification after the invocation of the tested methods
 <br><br>
 Postconditions: the methods implemented must always modify the list so that the elements contained are exactly those expected starting from their manual insertion
 <br><br>
 Execution record: each tested method is correct if all the tests that verify the correct functioning give positive results. Correct execution of the entire test method can then be considered the execution record
 <br><br>
 Execution variables:
 <br>HList list - main empty list on which all methods common to HCollection and HList are tested
 <br>HList listWithData - non-empty list on which the iterator is tested
 <br>HCollection coll - object of type CollectionAdapter used to test methods that accept parameters like HCollection and to test methods of HCollection

 Similarly with the removal of that element.
 <br><br>Preconditions: the add () and remove () methods must be properly implemented and working
 <br><br>Postconditions: the returned value must correspond to the number of elements contained in the collection

 <br><br>Preconditions: the add () and remove () methods must be properly implemented and working

 <code>ListAdapter.iterator()</code>,
 <code>myAdapter.ListAdapter.IteratorAdapter#hasNext()</code>,
 <code>myAdapter.ListAdapter.IteratorAdapter#next()</code> and
 <code>myAdapter.ListAdapter.IteratorAdapter#remove()</code> methods are tested
 <br><br>Design test: an iterator is created, elements are added to the collection, an array is created with multiple calls of next () and elements with multiple calls of remove are eliminated. Exceptions for next () on empty collection or remove () are tested before calling next ()
 <br><br>Description: After creating the iterator, elements are added to the collection with the add (Object) method. Subsequently an array of Object is created, through a while loop that uses the hasNext () method, containing all the elements of the collection and is compared with the array obtained through the toArray () method. Finally, all the elements contained in the collection are removed by invoking cyclically (with the same while precedenet) the method next () and remove () to then verify that the collection has size 0
 <br><br>Preconditions: the size () and toArray () and add () methods must be correctly implemented and working
 <br><br>Postconditions: the iterator must be able to sequentially return and delete each file contained in the Collection. It must also communicate the presence or absence of other elements not removed
 <br><br>Expected results: the Object array is filled correctly with all the elements of the collection obtained with the iterator and the final size of the collection = 0</div>

 <br><br>Summary: comparable test with the toArray () method with the difference that, if it is large enough, the array passed as a parameter is used
 <br><br>Design Test:
 <br>Nothing is inserted into the collection and a partially occupied array is passed as a parameter
 <br>Some elements are inserted into the collection and a partially occupied array with a larger size is passed as a parameter
 <br>Some elements are inserted into the collection and a partially occupied array with a smaller size is passed as a parameter. Also test of the correct throw of the exception with null parameter
 <br><br>Description: for all three situations indicated by the design test, it is verified with the use of a manually created array that the tested method returns an array of Object, filled with null the greater the difference between the size of the array passed as parameter and the size of the collection, exactly the elements of the collection, or a new array always with the elements of the collection
 <br><br>Preconditions: The add (Object) method must be correctly implemented
 <br><br>Postconditions: the returned array must contain all the elements present in the collection on which the method is invoked and in the order with which they appear in the collection
 <br><br>Expected results: the method must return the array passed as a parameter with the objects of the collection, if large enough, otherwise return another one with a size equal to the number of objects in the collection.

 <br><br>Summary: the test verifies that the addAll (HCollection) method inserts all the elements contained in the collection passed as a parameter in the collection in which the method is invoked
 <br><br>Design test: initially the tested method is invoked with a null collection to verify the correct throwing of the exception. Then a non-null collection is created in which elements are inserted. This collection is used as a parameter of the tested method invoked on a collection that already contains data to verify that the elements of the collection (parameter) are added but not removed from the main collection. Checked if an exception was thrown
 <br><br>Description: to verify that the tested method works correctly, elements are added both to the list used as a parameter and to the list in which the method will be invoked (in which the elements will be inserted). These operations are carried out to verify that after the invocation of the tested method the only changes that occurred in the main collection were only the addition of the values ​​contained in the parameter collection and that no elements already present in the main collection were deleted (verified with the of the final size of the main collection which must assume a size equal to the previous one + size of the parameter collection)
 <br><br>Preconditions: the add (Object obj) method and the containsAll (HCollection coll) method must be correctly implemented

Furthermore, the throw of exception is also checked in the case of an invalid index with respect to the positions that the iterator can take
 <br><br>Description: to verify that the method works correctly, an iterator is created on a list containing values, and the next () method is invoked to verify that the returned value is the one expected with respect to the position passed as a parameter to the tested method.

 <br><br>Preconditions:
